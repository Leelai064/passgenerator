# Password Generator Project

## Project Information

```
Many websites require the user to create a username and password to for their profile. As a security measure websites encourage the user to make a case sensitive password to protect their information from other parties. This project showcases my skill in creating a password generator with special characters and length criteria. Applying this skill to future projects will allow future users to feel safe knowing that their account is secure.

## Project Information
```
This project was mentally exhausting. My logic is on the right path but my execution could use some work. I intend to keep expanding my knowledge on java, but I feel as if my lack in background knowledge in java has let me down here. I could not get the generate button to start the prompts. Got the prompts to work but after making some edits they no longer work either. I went through a lot of bumps with this project and put a lot of time into it. My last bump in the road was not being able to even deploy the sad site. This project was frustrating, and I feel like I put my best and I will continue to until my site works properly, but until then I feel defeated.
