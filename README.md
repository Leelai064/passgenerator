# Password Generator

## Project Decription

```
Many websites require the user to create a username and password for their profile. As a security measure websites encourage the user to make a case sensitive password to protect their information from other parties. I wanted to better understand the logic behind if else statements, for loops, variables, functions. That being said, as I went through this project, I was introduced to Math.floor and Math.random for the first time. By using both functions with my logic I learned how to utilize user based decisions to create a code that responds to their needs. All in all seeing the work it takes to create user respondant events can be applied to future user-interactive projects.
