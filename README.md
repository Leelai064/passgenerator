# Password Generator Project

## Project Information

```
Many websites require the user to create a username and password to for their profile. As a security measure websites encourage the user to make a case sensitive password to protect their information from other parties. This project showcases my skill in creating a password generator with special characters and length criteria. Applying this skill to future projects will allow future users to feel safe knowing that their account is secure.
